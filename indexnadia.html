	<p>The ocean is one of
	the largest ecosystems on Earth.
	It generates half of the oxygen we breathe
	and contains more than 97% of the worlds water.
	It also provides at least a sixth of the animal protein we eat.
	However, human activities have caused a serious impact on marine life,
	and the results are becoming clearer every day. Pollution and climate are among
	the major consequences that have triggered major declines in our marine life. Hence,
	our main purpose of this website is to spread the importance of taking care of the marine life.
	This is because we believe this kind of information needs to be spread continuously, in order for people
	to be aware on solving these issues together. By doing so, it will help our community to be thoughtful with
	our environment in order to create this world a better place to live in.</p>
