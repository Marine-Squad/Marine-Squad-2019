		<p style="text-align: justify;">The ocean is one of the largest ecosystems on Earth. It generates half of the oxygen we breathe and
		contains more than 97% of the world's water. It also provides at least a sixth of the animal protein we eat. However, human activities
		have caused a serious impact on marine life, and the results are becoming clearer every day. Pollution and climate are among the major
		consequences that have triggered major declines in our marine life. Hence, our main purpose of this website is to spread the importance
		of taking care of the marine life. This is because we believe this kind of information needs to be spread continuously, in order for people
		to be aware of solving these issues together. By doing so, it will help our community to be thoughtful with our environment in order to create
		this world a better place to live in.</p>
